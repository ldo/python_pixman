**python_pixman** is a (partial) Python language binding for the
[Pixman](http://pixman.org/) pixel-manipulation library, for use with
Python 3.2 or later. Pixman is useful for applying low-level pixel
effects, like convolution filters.

Installation is explained in the setup.py script. This module also
requires [Qahirah](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah), my Cairo graphics
wrapper, to be installed.

Unfortunately, there is no proper documentation for Pixman itself. I
have tried to make up for this by adding docstrings and other comments
in this Python wrapper. Thus, you can get some idea of the facilities
available from the Python interactive prompt:

    >>> import pixman
    >>> help(pixman)

The core is the Image object. This can not only hold an array of
pixels (a “bits image”), but Pixman also supports special Image types
which consist of indefinite extents of solid colours or colour
gradients. Of course, these non-bits image types can only be used as
sources for drawing operations, not destinations.

For convenience, the Image object provides a create_cairo_surface
method that returns a Cairo ImageSurface wrapping the same pixels as
the Image. Of course, this only works for bits images. Conversely,
there is also a create_from_cairo_surface method that takes a Cairo
ImageSurface and returns a Pixman bits Image wrapping the same pixels.

These two interconversions allow you to mix Cairo drawing operations
with Pixman pixel manipulations, provided you follow the rules
explained in the Cairo documentation about using flush() and
mark_dirty().

Another important object is the Filter. Whereas the underlying C call
looks like

    pixman_image_set_filter(image, filter_type, params, nr_params);

the Python version encapsulates all the filter settings into a single
object:

    image.set_filter(filter)

The filter types that take no parameters are represented by predefined
Filter objects. Thus, whereas in C you would write

    pixman_image_set_filter(image, PIXMAN_FILTER_BEST, NULL, 0);

in Python this would become

    image.set_filter(pixman.Filter.BEST)

The Filter class provides methods for constructing filter types that
take parameters. What Pixman calls a “separable convolution”, I just
call a “resampler”, because that seems to be its purpose: to resample
an image in various high-quality ways when scaling.

Examples of python_pixman in action are available in the
[python_pixman_examples](https://github.com/ldo/python_pixman_examples)
repository.
